\subsection{What's in a Browser}
TODO:

\section{Logging IN}
Once OCEMR is loaded in a supported browser, the
system will require the user to fill out the user name and password.
Every user has a unique user name and password. The user name and
password are both case sensitive. If a user originally used only lower
case letters when the user was first created, the user will only be
able to successfully log in to the system with lower case letters. In
order to log in to the system the user must enter the user name and
password and then click \textbf{Submit }or press the \textbf{Enter} key
on the keyboard.

\section{The Interface}
While logged in the main page of the user interface, the system
always has the same look and feel.
